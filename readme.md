# Web Components

This repository aims to explore and create commonly used web components following two main goals:

- **Accessible:** The component must comply with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) recommendations, improving users' interaction regardless of the device, gadget, or technology
- **Progressive enhanced:** The component must provide decent usability for the core functionality on older devices and browsers before including improvements like visual style, animations, or extra features.

An extra goal is to use a minimum or no JavaScript and rely mostly on HTML and CSS properties.

This project is in continuous progress, be aware that it could not present all the ideal best practices at the moment or fit your necessity like a specific browser or screen reader.
